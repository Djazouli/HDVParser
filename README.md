I already know Django pretty well, so I will be using sqlalchemy for the db management, in order to learn some new stuff.
If I have to visualize data at the end, I may try flask, but I have to give it some thought, it may be overkill.

Good opportunity to learn parallelism, and how to design independant blocks (good for unittesting though)
